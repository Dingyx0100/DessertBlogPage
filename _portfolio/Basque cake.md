## Introduction
Basque cake is one of the simplest, low requirements and beginners friendly cakes. When I first came to the states, I don't have automatic egg beaters so there's a limit range of cakes I can make. Basque cake requires only a few ingredients and also only need a egg whisk to mix everything together. The recipe I used is from Maxkitchen, check out the link[^1].

**Ingredients** (for 6 inch round cake mold):
 - Cream Cheese 350g
 - cane sugar 90g (I usually go by 75g or less)
 - 2 full eggs and one single egg yolk
 - Heavy Whipping Cream 150g
 - Cake Flour 10g
 
Yeah it's that simple. And all you need to do is mix everything together. It is recommended that you follow the steps below:
1. Leave the cream cheese until it's soft enough to be easily pressed into.
2. Mix the cream cheese with the sugar.
3. Add the eggs in one by one, make sure you fully mixed one before you add another.
4. Add the Cream.
5. Filter in the cake flour.
6. Filter (recommended not required) the mixture into the cake mold.
7. Bake 25-28 minutes with temperature 230℃ or 446℉
8. Cool under room temperature then put the cake into refrigerator for at least 1 hours.

## Tips
There ain't much to say but there are some factors that would affect your outcoming bakery.
- About the **sugar amount**: I personally don't like cakes to be too sweet, but for basque cake, you might have noticed it has a slightly burnt surface on the top of it. **The sugar amount will influence the color of the top layer**. If you want the top of the cake to have a beautifully burnt color, then it's recommended that you follow the use of sugar in the original recipe (especially when you are serving the basque cake alone). Sometimes you might add other layers onto the basque cake, like creams or mousse, then the color doesn't matter as much.
- About the baking time: It is recommended Usually you can shake the cake to see if it still remains a fluid-like status.
