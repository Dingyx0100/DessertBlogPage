Hello Everyone! I'm Yuxin, and welcome to my dessert blog. As you might have known, baking is one of my favorite hobbies. I can't say I'm good at baking honestly, but I crave sweet food too much and I really enjoy exploring all types of sweet food and baking them. My dream is to one day own a Pastry+Book shop. It sounds like a distant goal for me now since I haven't been really settled down in a place or saved enough money for that yet. But! As they say, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. So, Iâ€™ve decided to start by sharing the pastries I come across and some of my favorite recipes. 

I didn't quite have the confidence of running a blog thing at first, but as I started with preparing it, I found that I can actually write more than I expected, might be in a garrulous way though. But if you are interested in what I'm eating or baking, or you just want to read a easy, fun post of dessert, you are very welcome to drop by my blog. I'll keep working to bring more contents on baking and pastries, as well as refining the website to be more interactive and pretty.

One thing I have to say is, I'm a very much P person based on mbti. The updates on the website could be very random, but it will keep going as long as my passion does not fade away.

Wishing you all a wonderful day filled with delicious pastries and a perfect cup of coffee in hand!!
