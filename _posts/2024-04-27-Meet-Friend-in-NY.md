title: Meeting my friends in New York this weekend

One of my high school best friends is visiting New York this week so I figured I can take the train up to meet him and do a one day trip in NY. I took an early train to get there early so we can get bagels together and enjoy the morning in the MET.

Basically when you haven't met your friends for a while and you are also not chatting much on your phone, then you won't stop talking at all after you meet each other. That's how I felt. But I tried to control myself not to talk to much in the museum so we can just appreciate art pieces lol.

We met with another friend in NY for lunch in a Thai Restaurant that I've been to. Their food are amazing and they also have very attracting decorations in the restaurant. Last time I came, we sat near the door so I didn't get a chance to see all this. Sometimes it's not bad to go back to somewhere you've been, probably there's always something waiting to surprise you.

After our trip to MOMA (recommended by our friend), we went to a dessert shop that I have put in my list for long called Lady Wong. We ordered three little desserts (though there's two of us?) but I don't remember the exact name of them. Honestly not extremely as good as I thought. I'd rather say they are prettier than they actually taste. If I have to give a ranking then it's mango > seasame > matcha. You really can never go wrong with mango. There should be a crime for making mango dessert bad tasting (jk). I feel like seasame is a very Chinese or at least Asian thing, correct me if I'm wrong, I probably have just seen too less. In China, it's said to be good for your hair to eat black foods, seasame, black beans, etc.
