It's a sadly a gloomy day, and pretty windy as well. My friend and I was planning to go to Cafe Dear Leon together, and we took the No.21 Bus down to the canton area. We got there around 9:03AM and there's already a long line waiting to get the pastries.

I was obviously showing my surprise about the long line, but my friend seemed to get used to it already. Nevertheless, we join the line and I got Ispahan Danish and Creme Brulee Tart. It was raining a bit, so we walked a little to a coffee shop nearby. The cafe is also pretty packed, not sure if it's due to the rain or just a daily basis. We are lucky enough to find a seat to enjoy our pastry though.

It's a pity that the danish was knocked over (?) during our walk probably, so it didn't look as good as their instagram showed. It tasted extremely good regardless. On the top it's raspberry and lychee with raspberry white chocolate ganache creams. Very nicely decorated and just enough sweetness. Inside the danish shell was a layer of raspberry gel, which added a bit more sour sweet flavor to the whole danish. Togother with the crispy danish shell, it gave an amazing taste.

We spent sometime in the library afterwards and walked down to the Canton Waterfront Park to watch the Kinetic Sculpture Race. We got there a bit late and there's a lot of people standing on the hill already. The Waterfront Park is kind of a turning spot where people need to take their kinetic sculpture into the water (turning from bike to a boat somehow), "swim" back to the ground, then head to the Patterson Park. It's a very creative, fun activity. I heard their bike sculptures have to gone through different type of road including mud. They also designed their sculptures to be very attractive -- we like one yellow duck kinetic sculpture in specific but I forgot to take a picture. One of my friends was trying to urge people join the race with him, but I was pretty sure he's just kidding.

I had my plan for the afternoon so I waved my friends goodbye as they were leaving with the sculpture teams and going to the Patterson Park. I walked in the rain towards Fells point along the road by the harbor, and enjoyed some quiet, peaceful time alone with music. I took a photo of the crepe shop when I got around the ramen restaurant I was aiming for. Really like the bike and flower outside their store, so cute!

It's truly nice to take a walk in the light rain. And then have a nice bowl of hot ramen to warm your body up. I stopped by another cafe to do some reading and enjoy the other dessert I bought. The Creme Brulee Tart was, however, less surprising. Sadly the crispy shell on the top of it was melting a little, and the inside filling was just like normal egg tarts. It still tasted good though.
