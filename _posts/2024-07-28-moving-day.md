It is a nice beautiful day and my first day in the new house after moving! I saw the story Maillard Patisserie sent and their peach basket looks absolutely amazing, so I decided, yeah, let's go get it!

The pastry is very nice. There is no special highlight in the taste, but it is very well blended and the sweetness is moderate. The "basket" part is similar to regular croissant but rather in a egg tart's shape. Underneath the peach is a creamy part that tasted like custard cream. Personally, I think the most outstanding feature of this product is how they deal with the peaches. The color is so pretty, and looks very appetizing. Looks great in photos too.
