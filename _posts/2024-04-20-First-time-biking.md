title: Biking Adventure around Baltimore

I've been wanting to get a bike for a while, basically because I don't like driving but still want to explore the city. I could take buses...but it's a bit limited sometimes. When I talked about this idea with my friend, she suggested me borrow a bike and ride around to see if I actually want a bike. I wasn't taking her suggestions very seriously at the time cuz I thought I was doing great biking in the gym...but I reckon it won't hurt to give it a try though.

There is a very nice bike lane going north and south bound on the Maryland Ave (I think it's previously called Cathedral street or something) that kind of connect the homewood campus and area around Inner Harbor. The bike lane was fine, but there's in fact too many up and downs in baltimore and I was already pretty tired when I reached Mt. Vernon Area. 

And I didn't eat anything before I left, which is a huge mistake. I was originally aiming for Cafe Dear Leon but I ended up in SACRE.SUCRE. They have a variety of options in croissants, cakes and macarons. So I ordered one in each categories ðŸ˜‚: a almond croissant, a opera cake and 4 different flavors macarons (raspberry, dark chocolate, matcha and earl grey).

I was starving so I wolfed down the almond croissant and the opera cake while I was in the store. The almond croissant didn't give me much surprise. I did like the opera cake though. It's very smooth and chocolate tasting, a bit sweet but just the right sugar after a bike ride. The macarons on the other hand wasn't quite satisfying. I guess I am just not into macarons. I do prefer the raspberry and dark chocolate ones -- Matcha flavor is somehow too sweet, and earl grey flavor is wierd and too sweet.

If I have to give a comment on the store, I think their stuffs are prettier than they actually tastes. My friend recommended me to try their pain suisse after I told her what I ordered. I guess I'll try that next time?
