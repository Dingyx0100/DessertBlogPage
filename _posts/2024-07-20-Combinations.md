Once in a month, it's time to go back to Cafe Dear Leon. As I said, each month they have some new items updated to the menu and some old ones removed. I was aiming for the chausson aux peche and soboro bun this month.

The Chausson aux blablabla is traditional french pastry that could be translate to blablabla turnover. So Chausson aux Peche is a peach turnover and Chausson aux Pommes (more commonly seen I guess?) is an apple turnover. Usually it comes with a rather crispy outside and some fruit + jam mixed fillings. For their Chausson aux Peche, I like the outside part pretty much -- and look how beautiful it is in the picture, decorated by pistachio matcha crumbs -- but the inside peach fillings are a bit of disappointment. I haven't make peach jam before but I think the flavor is not very peachy somehow. But maybe it's just because peach simply doesn't provide a strong flavor. I mean, cherry never gives a strong flavor saying it's cherry when it's made to be jam...so probably peach is the same.

I had the Soboro bun for breakfast the next day and I like it pretty much. It was way larger than I thought though. I was expecting a palm size bun probably the size as a pineapple bun, but it's almost my full hand size big. And to be honest, I was actually updating this blog a month later, because -- I realize I mismatched something they gave me.

So if you take a look at the picture above from their instagram, you'll realize there's a creamy little ball beside the pastry. It is said in their introduction that it's the vanilla mascarpone cream. When they give me the pastries, they put it in a little box and I misunderstood that it goes with the soboro bun. So what I did was basically spreading the cream onto the soboro bun while I was eating. The soboro bun has no fillings and the combination was great. I largely enjoyed doing so -- until I found out it's not meant to be like that. And I found out the truth because the next time I was taking someone with me to the pastry shop, he ordered soboro bun but didn't get anything. After checking the instagram, everthing's clear ðŸ˜‚.

But anyway, I guess there's a supposed way to eat the cream but there's as always no single correct way to do it. As long as it's good, it's the correct way. Bon appetit friends!
