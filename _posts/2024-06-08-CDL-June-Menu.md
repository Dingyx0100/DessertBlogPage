Going Back to Cafe Dear Leon for the new menu today! It's a nice sunny day today, just right for enjoying the pastries in the park and do some reading on the bench under the beautiful sunshine.

I ordered the strawberry half moon croissant and the mango danish today. For the first one, you can already guess its shape from the name lol. It has strawberry, hazelnut and cream on the top of it for decoration, and inside it's cream with hazelnut sauce. Very delicious and pretty pastry, except it's a bit small and I wish to continue eating it. The mango danish is also very good, it's a long rectangular shape, with mango and some spices on the top of it. It reminds me of Mexican where they eat mango with chilis.

I also had a bite from my friends order -- the Ham & Cheese Croissant. Usually I don't order savory food in pastry shop but this one definitely changed my mind. The cheese melted and gave a very creamy taste that nicely blended with the ham's saltiness. Together with the crispy out side of the croissant, one bite is like in the heaven.

Maybe I should be more open-minded to all kinds of pastries though...but I only come out for pastries once a week, I can't buy too many TAT.
