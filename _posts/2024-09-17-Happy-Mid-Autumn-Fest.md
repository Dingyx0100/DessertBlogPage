Happy Mid-Autumn Festival! Hope you all have a warm reunion with families and friends to celebrate the festival.

It wasn't until last time, when I told my friend I'm going to make mooncake and he asked "what is it for? are you celebrating anything?", that I realize we are not doing a good job promoting our festival. I'm not sure how many people actually care what festivals are foreigners celebrating but at the moment my friend is showing great respect and listened carefully as I tried to illustrate what is mooncake and what is the festival. I feel the need to write a blog on this and to welcome anyone interested in this part of the culture to have a clue on what's going on.
