I went to DC with my friend for Ear Piercing today! We also stopped by Dupont circle and bought pastries from this French Pastry shop called Un je ne sais Quoi...(p.s. "..." is included in its name ðŸ˜‚)

Let's start with introducing the pastry first. I saw a variety of French Pastries in their google map reviews, nevertheless, I didn't see what I want to order at the time we went. I ended up ordering a pistachio croissant, a canele and a bun. The croissant was a bit sticky and overly sweet for me, I thought there would be pistachio cream inside but not quite. It was my first time having a canele and I pretty much like it. But it's not crispy on the outside anymore, I'm not sure if it should be. I definitely need to order canele from different pastry shop for comparison. The bun is the best order out of the three. I don't quite remember the flavor name but I think it's rose something lol.

Some of my friends may have already seen the story I posted about the conversation I had with a shop owner. I've seriously thinking about getting ear pierced for such a long while but my friend in the college told me, her friend got her piercing and was screaming her pain into the cold wind as soon as she pulled open the piercing place's door and left. That left me such a deep impression that I hesitated years before I made up my mind.But it turns out fine. I can barely feel anything after two hours. For those who wants to get their ear pierced as a reference, chooce places that use needles instead of guns. Needles cause much less pain and also has much lower risk of future inflammation.
