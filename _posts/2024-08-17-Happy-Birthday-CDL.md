A late Happy Birthday to one of my favorite pastry shops in Baltimore! Their actual birthday is probably weeks ago, but they are selling the birthday croissant to celebrate their anniversary again. I, on the other hand, was trying to introduce this brilliant cafe to my friend who just arrived in Baltimore. So...definitely cannot miss out the special croissant!

The Birthday Croissant has the "Full Moon Croissant" shape, and also differs in texture from the horn-shaped croissants. It has a thin layer of white chocolate on the surface and is decorated with colorful sprinkles. The interior is filled with vanilla-flavored cream and mixed-berry jam. The berry jam provides a sweet and sour flavor, which nicely neutralizes the greasiness of the cream and surface frosting. In general it's a nice, refreshing pastry and just the enough sugar to start the day energetically.

I really wanted to try their Full Moon Tiramisu Croissant, which looks absolutely tempting. But unfortunately they removed it from the menu before I got a chance to go. Hope they will sell it again one day. (Hear my wish plzzzzzzz!)

I did a bit of searching on who invented this name for full moon croissant but got no clue. There were a similar type of croissant popular in China called growth rings record croissant (年轮唱片可颂). No matter who came up with these names, I'd say they are genius.
