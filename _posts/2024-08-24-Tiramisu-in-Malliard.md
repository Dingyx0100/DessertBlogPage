For no reason, I crave Tiramisu once in a while...

But somehow making Tiramisu by myself requires a lot of materials I don't normally use. Meaning I need to buy a bunch of things and could ended up not being able to use them all by the best-used-before-date or making a big big portion that I can't finish. Therefore, I was more than happy to see Tiramisu sold in Maillard Patisserie this weekend. (And I hope it fixed on the menu forever, but not likely...)

I didn't taste much alcohol, but it does have the smell of coffee. The finger biscuits are just right in moisture, unlike those sold in some stores that are too wet and have coffee dripping out (kinda messy). The mascarpone cream part was traditional or normal, just the exact taste I was expecting. The overall flavor was great, and the layer of cocoa powder on top was definitely the finishing touch.

I also got their fig & honey pie. Although the overall sweetness is a bit high, it is undeniable that the taste is eye-catching. Maybe because it is a honey pie, the inside of the tart is relatively sticky. It feels like eating caramel Fig mainly plays a decorative role lol, and does not affect the overall flavor much.

I feel like we don't have much fig dessert in China except from dried fig or fig jam, which are easier for storage. Therefore it's definitely a new experience and interesting to see so many pastry shops using fig in their dessert in this season.
