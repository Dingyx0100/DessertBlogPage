Last weekend has been busy, so I decided to treat myself nice this weekend by going out for dessert again. I went to Maillard and got myself a Chocolate Ganache and Passion Fruit Caramel Tart, a pawpaw cream puff, a mocha mousse cake and a chocolate croissant.

There will be a detailed description on the croissant in the comparison post, but I need to say again, it's really good. A fun fact is that, the person in front of me ordered five croissants and nothing else. I was thinking, hmmm, that must be your breakfast for the next whole week and you must have really liked their croissants. Turns out their croissants are amazing.

The rest of the order are less of a surprise to me. For the tart, I was expecting a bit of more flavor of passion fruit in the caramel part, but it's more of sweetness than that. The chocolate ganache part has the correct moderate sweetness and looks pretty though. For the pawpaw cream puff, I'm not sure if the pawpaw is the one I thought it was, but the flavor is not very strong as well. I was regretting a bit that I didn't get the pistachio flavored cream puff, but then I thought, hmmm, pistachio also don't give a very strong flavor and it's also green, so probably won't be a great difference. The outside of the puff was an average level - overall it tastes good but nothing special.

For the cake part...seriously I've been buying their cake a lot, because the combination really attracts me. I was trying to summarize a reason why I was disappointed a lot, I guess it's because I don't like the cake's body part? It's a very solid type of taste, while I usually prefer more light, fluffy ones. Me myself bake Chiffon more as the body part. My very personal view is that, it would blend better with either the cream or the mousse part you wanna add on the top.
