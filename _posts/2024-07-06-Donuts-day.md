It's very wierd today because I usually don't like or want to eat donuts. I do like bagels a lot especially blueberry bagels, but for donuts I feel like they are much more sweet and oily and greasy. But I somehow feel like visiting this nice little pastry shop and get some donuts today.

I blamed Timbit (my friend's hamster, they named her after timbit, refering to the fried dough removed from the center of a donut, because she looks round I guess?) for making me crave donuts on my instagram story lol. It's totally not her fault but who else can I blame ðŸ˜‚?

So here I am, I took the bus all the way down to this cute, pretty, little pastry shop called Dulceology Bakery. Tbh, I first notice this bakery because someone left a review in some other pastry shop blaming them for not doing a great work and claimed she's turning to Dulceology Bakery for the next order. The bakery looks gorgeous on the outside, very cute and has macaron styled color. I ordered two types of donuts, the first was a square shaped donuts with creme brulee shell. The other one is a simple fried donut with chocolate fillings. They are unsurprisingly too sweet for me to be honest, but since I am craving sugar I guess they did their job perfectly?

Speaking of donuts, it always brings me back to my college time in Shanghai. I have a friend from the same societies and we used to go out together for fun. He's very obssessed with sweet food, donuts in specific and there's a dunkin donuts' shop in the shopping mall near our school that he usually buy donuts from.
